    <p>Rasmalai is a classic Indian dessert consisting of soft, spongy cheese dumplings soaked in a sweet, thickened milk, and flavored with cardamom and saffron. The name comes from two Hindi words: "ras," meaning juice or syrup, and "malai," meaning cream. Originating from the Bengal region of the Indian subcontinent, it is a beloved sweet served chilled and garnished with nuts like pistachios and almonds.
